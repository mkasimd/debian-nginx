To add additional modules, put the modules into the directory `modules` and change the cpompiler flags in `debian/rules` accordingly.
Be reminded that this source assumes that the code and especially the modules are located in `/usr/local/src/`, 
thus you might have to change the compiler flags according to your file path.
